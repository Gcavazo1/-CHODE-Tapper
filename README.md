# CHODE TAPPER: GIRTH TO EARN - Landing Page Project

## üçÜ Project Overview

Welcome, fellow architect of Girth, to the foundational code of the CHODE Tapper: Girth to Earn landing page! This isn't just a website; it's the digital altar where prospective Chode Champions will first witness the divine power of the Sacred Tap and pledge their allegiance to the pursuit of $GIRTH.

Based on the sacred texts of [The Ascension Manifesto](link_to_your_manifesto_pdf_or_online_version), this landing page aims to capture the raw, unapologetic energy of the game, tease the core mechanics and economy, and convert visitors into loyal followers and future players.

**It's time to make the internet Girthy.**

## ‚ú® Features & Sections

This landing page is structured to guide degens from curiosity to fervent devotion. Key sections include:

* **The GigaChode Proclamation:** The epic hero section. Game title, tagline, hook, and primary calls to action (Waitlist & Follow).
* **The Degen Prophecy:** Why CHODE Tapper is the answer to the crypto-verse's soul-crushing seriousness. Highlights the core vision (Degen, Addictive, Visual, Web3 Enhanced).
* **The Altar of Girth:** A glimpse into the core gameplay loop (Tap, Charge, Mega Slap, Ejacu-Girth) and the powerful Degen Power-Ups ($GIRTH generation via Boosts).
* **The Scrolls of Girthonomics:** Showcases the economy and progression ‚Äì evolving your $CHODE, upgrades, cosmetic customization, and rare skins.
* **The GigaChode Ethos & Community:** Introduces the philosophy (Absurdity, Ownership, Community) and highlights optional Web3 features (NFTs, Leaderboard) and social channels.
* **Footer:** Essential links and legal disclaimers (degen style).

The design principle is **"Cyberpunk Dumpster Fire Chic"** ‚Äì expect neon, glitches, high contrast, and visuals that pop harder than a perfectly timed Mega Slap.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*(Placeholder - We will define this in the next step!)*

Describe the core technologies used to build this landing page (e.g., HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, React/Vue/Svelte, Static Site Generator, Animation Library, etc.).
This landing page is forged with the following sacred technologies:

* **Framework:** Next.js (React) - For component-based UI, Static Site Generation (SSG), routing, and a robust build process.
* **Language:** TypeScript - For type safety and enhanced developer experience.
* **Styling:** SCSS (Sass) - For powerful CSS preprocessing, enabling variables, nesting, and mixins to manage our "Cyberpunk Dumpster Fire Chic" aesthetic. Key files include `src/styles/global.scss`, `src/styles/_variables.scss`, and module-specific `.module.scss` files.
* **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) - Selected for its power and flexibility in creating high-performance, complex animations to bring the Girth to life.
* **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint & Prettier - To maintain code purity and consistency.
* **Package Management:** npm (or yarn/pnpm as per developer preference) - For managing all project dependencies.

## üìù Development Notes & Goals

* Bring the "Cyberpunk Dumpster Fire Chic" aesthetic to life with CSS/animations.
* Implement the core section layout based on the `landing_page_concept.md`.
* Integrate responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices (especially mobile!).
* Set up a functional email collection for the Girth Waits List (consider a simple backend or service integration).
* Ensure social media links are correctly configured.
* Optimize assets (images, GIFs) for performance.
* Explore subtle animations and visual effects that align with the game's energy (pulsing elements, glitch effects, particle bursts).
**Current Girthy Priorities (Post-Refractory Ascension):**

1.  **Visual Invigoration ‚Äì Icons & Imagery (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
    *   Replace all `IconPlaceholder` components with actual, thematically aligned SVG icons.
    *   Source or create conceptual images/visuals for $CHODE Tiers, Cosmetic Themes, and Exotic Skins as detailed in `landing-page-concept.md`.
2.  **Animate the Absurdity ‚Äì GSAP Unleashed:**
    *   Infuse the HeroSection with initial animations (pulsing headlines, text glitches, entrance animations).
    *   Enhance hover/focus states on interactive elements.
    *   Implement scroll-triggered animations for section content reveals.
3.  **Functionalize the Funnels ‚Äì CTAs that Convert:**
    *   Develop the email capture functionality for the "Girth Waits List."
    *   Update all placeholder `href="#"` links with actual URLs (Twitter, Discord, Litepaper).
4.  **Font Forging & Typographic Titillation:**
    *   Ensure consistent and thematic application of chosen fonts (e.g., Geist, Geist_Mono) across all sections.
5.  **Polish the Monolith ‚Äì Responsiveness & Refinement:**
    *   Conduct thorough responsiveness testing and refinement, especially for mobile views.
    *   Fine-tune spacing, alignment, and overall visual consistency.
