Welcome to the **CHODE Tapper Interface Documentation**, the Ascended blueprint for our righteous clicker game experience. This document outlines the structural UI design, core systems, and blockchain-enabled glory, ensuring any backers, developers, or future disciples understand this isn't just a meme—it's a movement.

## 🧱 Interface Layout

### 🔘 Center Panel – The Tapper Area

- **Main Interaction Zone** (Top 2/3 center screen)
  - This is where the $CHODE is summoned.
  - Large tappable Chode Icon (animated and responsive).
  - **Overlay UI:** The **Girth Counter** floats at the top of this section—non-intrusive, prominent, and scaling dynamically with game milestones (e.g., font grows absurdly large at Girthillion+).
  
- **HUD Bar** (Bottom center)
  - Displays quick stats:
    - Tap Rate
    - Boost Status (active/passive)
    - Combo Meter / Chode Charge Status
    - Aura Score (for cosmetics / passive relic bonuses)
